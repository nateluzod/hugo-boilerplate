# CSS
CSS utility classes are added via [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). Add colors, fonts and more to tailwind.js. Because unmodified Tailwind produces a 200kb file, be sure to pare down colors and other things that will go unused. Also, be sure to utilize uncss to clean out unused classes from the final build.
